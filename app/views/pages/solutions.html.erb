		  <h3>Consolidated Billing</h3>
	   	  <p><span>The Challenge: </span> The Human Resources and Finance Department heads at a 125 employee company struggled to manage benefit plan invoices from three different insurance carriers for programs in multiple locations. Varying data from multiple carrier reports made cost analysis extremely difficult.</p>
	      <p><span>The Solution: </span>The client learned that Lighthouse not only consolidates invoices for multiple plans onto a single bill, but could also show the costs for each location or department separately depending on their needs. The invoice can also be downloaded into a workable Excel file, giving both HR and finance a tool to meet their unique needs for the data, such as verification of which employees are in what plans, reconciliation of employee payroll deductions, or verification of life and disability benefit amounts.</p>
	      <p><span>The Value: </span>This organization now receives one bill and remits one payment for all their benefits. The bills are available to view any time through the client's customized website and can be downloaded and manipulated to create various reports.</p>
	      <p><span>The Result: </span>Reconciliation, benefit verification, benefit costs and funding source allocation are much easier to manage and analyze. The client has found tremendous value in the ability to download and sort the invoice data for budget and expense projections.</p>

       <h2>The Power of One</h2>
       <p>Benefits Administration can be especially complicated, and when evaluating total plan expense, it is important to consider many factors, such as how many carriers you have in your plan, the various processes used to update eligibility, the time spent helping employees during enrollment, and reconciling carrier bills each month.</p>
